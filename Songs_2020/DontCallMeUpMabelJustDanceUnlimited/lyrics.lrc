[00:01.530] When I'm underneath the bright lights
[00:04.620] When I'm tryna have a good time
[00:06.840] 'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
[00:08.370] Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
[00:11.560] When you're looking at my photos
[00:13.950] Getting hot, losing control

[00:18.230] Now, now, now, now
[00:20.220] I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
[00:24.800] 'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
[00:28.830] And I know it's sad that I changed, have a cold heart
[00:33.110] But it was your game that lashed scars
[00:35.450] Ooh, I'm over you

[01:04.780] And everybody's on my vibe, babe
[01:07.000] Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
[01:09.780] My friends said you were a bad man
[01:11.930] I should have listened to them back then
[01:14.370] And now you're tryna hit me up again
[01:16.520] Now, now, now, now
